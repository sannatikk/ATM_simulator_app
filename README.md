# ATM Simulator App

This project serves as the second-semester software development project in the first year of my studies at the ICT Engineering program in OAMK, aiming to simulate the functionalities of an ATM application.

## Overview

The ATM Simulator App consists of two main components:

1. **Backend:** This is a Node.js application hosted remotely, utilizing the Express framework to provide API endpoints for communication with a remotely hosted MySQL database.
2. **Frontend:** The frontend is developed using Qt Widgets, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ATM functionalities.

## Requirements

- **Qt Version:** The frontend application requires a Qt version with SerialPort support enabled.
- **Operating Systems:** The app is compatible with both macOS and Windows.

## Features

The ATM Simulator App offers the following functionalities:

1. **Card Compatibility:** Supports both single and combination credit/debit cards.
2. **Account Information:** Users can view their account balance, credit limit, and available cash amount for withdrawal (minimum bill €20).
3. **Transaction History:** Provides a view of past transactions for reference.
4. **Withdrawals:** Users can make both fixed and customizable withdrawals according to their needs.
